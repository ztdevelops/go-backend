# Welcome to my Go application!

## Progress
Currently still a work in progress. Will be updating this as it goes along. :)

## How to start program
Added batch file `scripts.bat` for running multiple commands at once. To run the program,
1. Ensure you are in root directory of this project (go-backend)
2. Simply call `scripts.bat` and the program runs itself!

Do note: Upon closing of the actual program that runs all the Go code, you are required to NOT stop the program. Unless you would like to manually delete the src.exe file. :) Will look into this in future as this is not an expected behaviour. But for now, this is the workaround!

## Required files
If you would like to run the program, contact me for the required config files. I send you the required files (if you're on the team, of course!) and advice you on where to place the files.

# Welcome to my Go application!

## Progress
Currently still a work in progress. Will be updating this as it goes along. :)

## How to start program
Added batch file `scripts.bat` for running multiple commands at once. To run the program,
1. Ensure you are in root directory of this project (go-backend)
2. Simply call `scripts.bat` and the program runs itself!
